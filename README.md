# CodeBy Test

Hi! If you're here that means you need to be tested, right? Okay, let's get started then. First, install react and vtex using npm. Now take a quick look at VTEX IO Framework documentation if you are not already familiar with that: [Docs](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-io-getting-started). Last but not least, one more thing that will help on your test is the `vtex-apps` repository [(here)](https://github.com/vtex-apps/), which holds all the IO apps built by them. If you have any questions or doubts, first refer to the docs, then to the repository and last, to me.

# What we need?

We need you to build an **SKU Selector** that uses all the available product variations and converts the combination selected by the user to the respective SKU ID. With the SKU ID, you need to create a button to add the respective selected SKU to the cart. Please refer to the `vtex-apps` repository and the VTEX IO documentation for this. If you're not able to progress, please ask me your questions via email: **jean@codeby.com.br**.

## What should you use?

React and VTEX IO framework.

## Where can you test this?

Just email me asking for a workspace and access to the Codeby store. **jean@codeby.com.br**
